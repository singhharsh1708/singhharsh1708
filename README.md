🔍 Finding Creative Ways to Code Less, Achieve More

Hey there! I'm Harsh, a (slightly lazy) CSE student who loves to code, just not too much. Here, you'll find some of my projects, the occasional bug fix, and maybe a README or two. I'm all about efficient solutions—why do it the hard way when you can do it the smart way?

🌱 Learning Python, Java, and how to avoid the dreaded infinite loop.
☕ Fun Fact: I debug best with a cup of coffee in hand.
